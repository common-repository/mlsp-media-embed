Add MLSP media embed support to wordpress. Optionally add FitVids responsive media script that will resize all media embeds to fit any browser size.


== Description ==

This plugin will add MyLeadSystemPRO media embed support to wordpress. With this installed, you simply need to just past the link of your media from MLSP right in to the editor and WordPress will embed it for you, be it video or audio. 

As an added bonus, for those with responsive themes, we add the option of activating a script that will resize your MLSP media on the fly based the the user's browser size. This is an optional addition, but it can be extremely helpful for those with responsive themes. This option can be found right in your WordPress media options page.


== Installation ==

1. Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress 
installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page. OR just use the upload plugin 
function provided by wordpress and upload the .zip file directly.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. Head over to your media options to activate the responsive media functionality (Helpful if you use a responsive theme)
